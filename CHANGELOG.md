# Changelog

## 2.4.0 — 2026-04-14

### feat: drop openclaw integration

Removed the OpenClaw companion plugin (`openclaw-plugin/`) and its skill file (`skills/openclaw/`).

**Reason:** Enabling the plugin caused OpenClaw to spawn a new Claude Code session via its ACP agent backend for every bridge message — a feedback loop where each incoming message created a new Claude process. agent-bridge is now Claude-Code-only as a product. If OpenClaw support is revived later it will be its own contained integration, not a co-resident plugin in this repo.

**Files deleted:**
- `openclaw-plugin/` (bin/, src/, package.json, openclaw.plugin.json, README.md, PARITY_REPORT.md)
- `skills/openclaw/` (SKILL.md)

**Files edited:** README.md, INSTRUCTIONS.md, AGENTS.md, PLUGIN_DESIGN.md, site/index.html — all OpenClaw references removed. `mcp-server/package.json` and `mcp-server/src/index.ts` bumped to 2.4.0.

## 2.3.2 — 2026-04-14

### fix(mcp-server): tilde not expanded in remote inbox path — messages land in literal `~` directory

**Bug:** Every message sent via `bridge_send_message` wrote to a literal `~/.agent-bridge/inbox/`
directory on the remote machine instead of the user's real `$HOME/.agent-bridge/inbox/`. This
caused messages to accumulate silently in the shadow dir while the file watcher watched the real
inbox, so no messages were delivered.

**Root cause:** `sshWriteFile` in `src/ssh.ts` single-quoted the remote path:
```
mkdir -p "$(dirname '~/.agent-bridge/inbox/msg-XXX.json')" && ... > '~/.agent-bridge/inbox/msg-XXX.json'
```
Single quotes prevent shell tilde expansion — the shell treats `~` as a literal directory name.

**Fix:** Before building the remote command, replace a leading `~/` in the path with `$HOME/`
and wrap the path in double quotes so the remote shell expands `$HOME` correctly. The base64
payload remains single-quoted (safe, as it only contains `[A-Za-z0-9+/=]`).

**Files changed:** `mcp-server/src/ssh.ts` (8 lines added/changed in `sshWriteFile`).

## 2.3.1 — 2026-04-14

### OpenClaw companion — parity pass

Audited `openclaw-plugin/` against the v2.3.0 Claude Code plugin-ification
to confirm the OpenClaw side is in a coherent, installable state.

No code changes were needed. The OpenClaw plugin was already:
- Loading correctly on OpenClaw 2026.4.12 (`Status: loaded`).
- Free of hardcoded `/Users/<user>/...` paths (uses `$HOME` / `os.homedir()`
  throughout `src/` and `bin/`).
- Hardened identically to the Claude Code MCP server — `SIGINT` / `SIGTERM` /
  `SIGHUP` / `SIGPIPE` handlers, `stdin` end/close/error handlers, an orphan
  watchdog on `process.ppid`, and an `EPIPE` / `Broken pipe` detector on
  `uncaughtException` / `unhandledRejection`. All verbatim from `a88d614`.

Doc-only changes:
- `openclaw-plugin/README.md` — replaced the `/Users/USERNAME/...` launchd
  placeholder with a shell heredoc template that expands `$HOME` and
  `command -v node` / `command -v openclaw` before writing the plist (launchd
  does not expand `$HOME` inside `ProgramArguments`).
- `openclaw-plugin/PARITY_REPORT.md` — new. Documents the audit, the
  architectural differences between the two sides, the one cosmetic
  `reload registration missing prefixes` warning, and the install procedure
  on a fresh machine.

### Plugin-ification

agent-bridge can now be installed as a single Claude Code **plugin** that bundles BOTH halves of the integration:

- The MCP server (outgoing tools: `bridge_send_message`, `bridge_receive_messages`, `bridge_run_command`, `bridge_status`, `bridge_list_machines`, `bridge_clear_inbox`, `bridge_inbox_stats`).
- The channel (incoming push of remote messages as `<channel source="agent-bridge" ...>` events).

Previously the channel side required launching Claude with `--dangerously-load-development-channels --channels server:agent-bridge`, and the MCP-tools side required hand-editing `.mcp.json`. The two halves were never wired up together, so users routinely had one without the other.

**Install:**
```bash
cd ~/Projects/agent-bridge/mcp-server && npm install && npm run build
claude plugin marketplace add ~/Projects/agent-bridge
claude plugin install agent-bridge@agent-bridge
```

**New files:**
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — declares the repo as a local Claude Code marketplace.
- `mcp-server/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — plugin manifest.
- `mcp-server/.mcp.json` — registers the unified MCP+channel server with `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` path resolution.

The bash `agent-bridge` CLI is unchanged and still installed via `./install.sh` for pairing, SSH transport, and `agent-bridge run … --claude` agent-to-agent prompts. The plugin and the CLI coexist.

The unified server logic (single Node process advertising MCP tools AND emitting `notifications/claude/channel`) was already in place from v2.2.0; this release wires it into the Claude Code plugin system. All EPIPE / SIGHUP / orphan-watchdog hardening from `a88d614` is preserved verbatim.
