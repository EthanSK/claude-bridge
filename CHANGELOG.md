# Changelog

## 2.3.1 — 2026-04-14

### OpenClaw companion — parity pass

Audited `openclaw-plugin/` against the v2.3.0 Claude Code plugin-ification
to confirm the OpenClaw side is in a coherent, installable state.

No code changes were needed. The OpenClaw plugin was already:
- Loading correctly on OpenClaw 2026.4.12 (`Status: loaded`).
- Free of hardcoded `/Users/<user>/...` paths (uses `$HOME` / `os.homedir()`
  throughout `src/` and `bin/`).
- Hardened identically to the Claude Code MCP server — `SIGINT` / `SIGTERM` /
  `SIGHUP` / `SIGPIPE` handlers, `stdin` end/close/error handlers, an orphan
  watchdog on `process.ppid`, and an `EPIPE` / `Broken pipe` detector on
  `uncaughtException` / `unhandledRejection`. All verbatim from `a88d614`.

Doc-only changes:
- `openclaw-plugin/README.md` — replaced the `/Users/USERNAME/...` launchd
  placeholder with a shell heredoc template that expands `$HOME` and
  `command -v node` / `command -v openclaw` before writing the plist (launchd
  does not expand `$HOME` inside `ProgramArguments`).
- `openclaw-plugin/PARITY_REPORT.md` — new. Documents the audit, the
  architectural differences between the two sides, the one cosmetic
  `reload registration missing prefixes` warning, and the install procedure
  on a fresh machine.

## 2.3.0 — 2026-04-14

### Plugin-ification

agent-bridge can now be installed as a single Claude Code **plugin** that bundles BOTH halves of the integration:

- The MCP server (outgoing tools: `bridge_send_message`, `bridge_receive_messages`, `bridge_run_command`, `bridge_status`, `bridge_list_machines`, `bridge_clear_inbox`, `bridge_inbox_stats`).
- The channel (incoming push of remote messages as `<channel source="agent-bridge" ...>` events).

Previously the channel side required launching Claude with `--dangerously-load-development-channels --channels server:agent-bridge`, and the MCP-tools side required hand-editing `.mcp.json`. The two halves were never wired up together, so users routinely had one without the other.

**Install:**
```bash
cd ~/Projects/agent-bridge/mcp-server && npm install && npm run build
claude plugin marketplace add ~/Projects/agent-bridge
claude plugin install agent-bridge@agent-bridge
```

**New files:**
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — declares the repo as a local Claude Code marketplace.
- `mcp-server/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — plugin manifest.
- `mcp-server/.mcp.json` — registers the unified MCP+channel server with `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` path resolution.

The bash `agent-bridge` CLI is unchanged and still installed via `./install.sh` for pairing, SSH transport, and `agent-bridge run … --claude` agent-to-agent prompts. The plugin and the CLI coexist.

The unified server logic (single Node process advertising MCP tools AND emitting `notifications/claude/channel`) was already in place from v2.2.0; this release wires it into the Claude Code plugin system. All EPIPE / SIGHUP / orphan-watchdog hardening from `a88d614` is preserved verbatim.
