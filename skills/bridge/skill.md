# Agent Bridge Skill

You are an AI coding agent with agent-bridge installed. This machine is a **peer** in a bidirectional bridge -- it can both send commands to and receive commands from other paired machines.

## Discovery first — consult config + bridge_list_machines BEFORE making claims

Before answering ANY question about which machines are paired, which harnesses are running on which machine, or whether a specific target (e.g. `openclaw/default`, `claude-code/<persona>`) exists, you MUST first run `bridge_list_machines` and/or read `~/.agent-bridge/config`. Do NOT answer from memory.

Specifically required for:
- "Does <machine> have an OpenClaw / Claude Code session / a <persona> persona?"
- "Is <machine> paired?" / "How many machines are paired?"
- "Where should I route this message?" — re-check the registered targets before routing.
- "Which target should I use to reply?" — read `from_target` off the inbound `<channel>` block, then verify it's a known target via list.
- Any time the user names a target or a machine, before committing to an answer.

The check is cheap (single MCP tool call) and the cost of guessing wrong is being told off and re-doing the work. Re-check at the start of every relevant turn — pairings can change mid-session via `agent-bridge pair`/`unpair`. If `bridge_list_machines` is not loaded, fall back to `cat ~/.agent-bridge/config` via shell. Both must agree before you answer.

Established 2026-05-09 (cross-fleet rule — agents kept guessing wrong about which harnesses existed on which machines).

## When to activate

Activate when the user says things like:
- "connect to my MacBook" / "talk to the other machine"
- "run X on [machine name]"
- "check if [machine] is online"
- "pair with a new machine" / "add a remote machine"
- "what machines are connected?"
- "set up remote access" / "set up agent-bridge"
- "enable SSH for remote access"
- "let the other agent control this machine"
- Sends a photo of an agent-bridge pairing screen

## Setup (run on any machine you want to bridge)

```bash
agent-bridge setup
```

Options:
```bash
agent-bridge setup --name "MacBook-Pro"   # Custom machine name
agent-bridge setup --port 2222             # Custom SSH port
```

For off-LAN access, use [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) and point the paired machine's `internet_host` at its `100.x.y.z` IP (see README "Internet connectivity (Tailscale)").

### What setup does

1. **Enables SSH** (Remote Login on macOS) if not already on
2. **Generates an ED25519 key pair** at `~/.agent-bridge/keys/`
3. **Adds the public key** to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
4. **Displays a pairing screen** with all connection details
5. **Auto-adds agent-bridge instructions** to detected AI harness files (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`, `~/.openclaw/AGENTS.md`, `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md`) so every new session knows about the bridge. This also runs during `pair`.

### After setup

Tell the user to:
1. **Photograph the pairing screen** displayed in the terminal
2. **Send the photo** to the agent on the other machine (e.g., via Telegram)
3. The other agent will read the photo and complete the pairing

Alternatively, they can:
- Copy the manual pairing command shown on screen
- Copy the private key file to the other machine: `scp ~/.agent-bridge/keys/agent-bridge_<name> other-machine:~/.agent-bridge/keys/`

## Available commands

All commands use the `agent-bridge` CLI:

### Check paired machines
```bash
agent-bridge list
```

### Check machine status
```bash
agent-bridge status              # All machines
agent-bridge status MacBook-Pro  # Specific machine
```

### Run a plain shell command remotely (diagnostics only)
```bash
agent-bridge run MacBook-Pro "ls -la ~/Projects"
agent-bridge run MacBook-Pro "cd ~/Projects/myapp && git status"
agent-bridge run MacBook-Pro "brew update && brew upgrade"
```

> `agent-bridge run` is a plain remote-shell utility. It does NOT spawn or invoke an agent. The `--claude`, `--codex`, and `--agent` flags were removed in 3.0.0 — they ran a fresh non-interactive agent session on the remote machine, which is the opposite of what this project is for.

### Talk to the RUNNING remote agent (agent-to-agent)

Use the `bridge_send_message` MCP tool from the channel plugin:

```
bridge_send_message({
  machine: "MacBook-Pro",
  message: "fix the failing tests in ~/Projects/myapp",
  target: "claude-code/default"
})
```

For `target: "claude-code/default"` (or `"claude-code/<persona>"`), the message is pushed into that live Claude Code persona on MacBook-Pro as a `<channel source="agent-bridge" ...>` event, and the reply comes back the same way. Legacy `target: "claude-code"` is accepted only for rolling upgrades. OpenClaw targets use `target: "openclaw/<account>"` and are delivered by the separate `openclaw-channel/` plugin. In all cases, use `bridge_send_message` for agent-to-agent work — do not shell out to fresh agent wrappers.

**OC persona routing.** When the user names an OpenClaw persona (`Claude the third` / `Clord` → `openclaw/clordlethird`, `Claudibo` / `Claude two` → `openclaw/clawdiboi2`, `Claude Station Mini` / unspecified → `openclaw/default`), match LITERALLY — do not default to `openclaw/default`. Voice transcripts mis-hear persona names; re-read before routing. Canonical: [`docs/oc-persona-routing.md`](../../docs/oc-persona-routing.md).

### Open an interactive SSH session
```bash
agent-bridge connect MacBook-Pro
```

### Pair a new machine
```bash
# With flags:
agent-bridge pair --name "MacBook-Pro" --host 192.168.1.50 --port 22 --user ethan --token bridge-a7f3k9 --pubkey "ssh-ed25519 AAAA..."

# Interactive:
agent-bridge pair
```

### Remove a pairing
```bash
agent-bridge unpair MacBook-Pro
```

## Pairing from a photo

When the user sends a photo of another machine's pairing screen:

1. Read the image (you can see images natively)
2. Extract these fields from the pairing screen:
   - Machine Name
   - Username
   - Local IP (or Public IP if connecting over the internet)
   - Port
   - Token
   - Public Key
3. Run the pair command:
```bash
agent-bridge pair --name "<name>" --host "<ip>" --port <port> --user "<user>" --token "<token>" --pubkey "<pubkey>"
```
4. Then test: `agent-bridge status <name>`

## Transferring the private key

Setup generates a key pair on each machine. The private key must be on the connecting machine to authenticate. Options:
1. **Manual copy**: `scp other-machine:~/.agent-bridge/keys/agent-bridge_<name> ~/.agent-bridge/keys/`
2. **Use existing SSH keys**: If you already have SSH access, skip the key step

## Typical workflows

### "Deploy my app on the MacBook"
```bash
agent-bridge run MacBook-Pro "cd ~/Projects/myapp && git pull && npm install && npm run build"
```

### "Ask the remote agent to review my code"

From inside your agent session (with the channel plugin loaded):

```
bridge_send_message({
  machine: "MacBook-Pro",
  message: "review the code in ~/Projects/myapp/src/ and suggest improvements",
  target: "claude-code/default"
})
```

The running remote default Claude Code persona receives it in-context and replies via `bridge_send_message` back to this machine. Use `target: "claude-code/<persona>"` for a named persona.

### "Check what's running on my other machine"
```bash
agent-bridge run MacBook-Pro "ps aux | head -20 && df -h && free -h 2>/dev/null"
```

### "Start a dev server on the MacBook"
```bash
agent-bridge run MacBook-Pro "cd ~/Projects/myapp && nohup npm run dev > /tmp/dev.log 2>&1 &"
```

## Relay inbound bridge messages to the user — send via the harness's reply tool

When a `<channel source="agent-bridge" ...>` block lands in this session, you MUST relay a brief 1-3 sentence summary to the user via the harness's configured user-facing channel (Telegram, Slack, Discord, native UI, etc.).

**As of agent-bridge 4.2.0 / openclaw-channel 3.2.0** the structural fields below are **emitted programmatically by the plugin** via the shared `lib/relay-notice.js` formatter — both `mcp-server/src/relay-notice.ts` (CC) and `openclaw-channel/src/relay-notice.js` (OC) re-export it. **CC inbound channel pushes prepend a fenced `[RELAY-SCAFFOLD-START] ... [RELAY-SCAFFOLD-END]` block to the channel content** (also exposed as the `meta.relay_scaffold` attribute on the `<channel>` tag). Lift that scaffold verbatim, replace the `{{SUMMARY_PLACEHOLDER}}` line with a `<blockquote><b>Summary:</b> 1-3 sentences</blockquote>` block, and send it via the harness's reply tool. The agent's only structural responsibility is the Summary blockquote — every other field is pre-filled.

Format reference (kept here as a fallback for cases where the scaffold isn't delivered — older plugin version, custom harness, scaffold stripped by an intermediate layer):

- Header (literal): `[Agent Bridge relay] 🛰️` — NOT 📡, NOT a free-form prefix. Hard-coded in the shared formatter.
- `source: <from-machine>[/<from-target>] (agent-bridge v<X.Y.Z>|unknown)` — read from `source_agent_bridge_version` when available; never hardcode.
- `destination: <to-machine>/<target> (agent-bridge v<A.B.C>|unknown)` — read from `destination_agent_bridge_version`; legacy `agent_bridge_version` is a destination/local alias.
- `received: <from-machine>[/<from-target>] → <to-machine>/<target>`
- `reply path: <comma-joined channels>` (typically `agent-bridge`, or `agent-bridge, telegram` when also relaying to a user).
- `message id: <msg-id>` (the `message_id` attribute on the inbound `<channel>` tag).
- `expand id: NN` + `expand: agent-bridge relay-expand NN` (OC only — has the relay-expand store; CC + other agent-driven harnesses omit these lines).
- Blank line, then 1-3 sentence summary of the actionable ask, then one line of action (`Replied via bridge with X` / `No reply needed, FYI` / `Holding for user input`).
- Trailing `<blockquote><b>Summary:</b> 1-3 sentence summary</blockquote>` block — same shape as the regular per-message Summary rule (where the harness uses HTML formatting).

**One relay = one user-facing message.** Don't bundle multiple bridge relays into one outbound. Don't bundle a relay with unrelated content. Each inbound `<channel>` block becomes exactly one outbound message containing only the structured `[Agent Bridge relay] 🛰️` block.

**MANDATORY: send the completed scaffold via the harness's user-facing reply tool — do NOT just leave it in the conversation.** When the routing layer emits a structured scaffold into the inbound `<channel>` block (or you compose one yourself), your job is to **relay it to the user**. After filling in the Summary blockquote placeholder (and any other empty fields), you MUST send the completed scaffold as a fresh user-facing message via the harness's configured user-facing channel reply tool — for Claude Code with the Telegram plugin that's the Telegram `reply` tool (`mcp__plugin_telegram_telegram__reply`); for OpenClaw it's the OC user-facing channel reply tool; for any other harness it's whatever user-facing reply tool is bound to the running session. The agent's role is to RELAY the scaffold to the user, not to acknowledge it in-conversation and stop. Acknowledgement-without-send means the user sees nothing on their phone; the scaffold only sat in the agent's transcript. Sending via the reply tool is the entire point of this rule. Established 2026-05-09 (Ethan voice 2348: "This also needs to say to relay it to the Telegram so the agent can do that").

## v2: MCP Server & Channel Plugin (running agent-to-agent communication)

If the agent-bridge MCP server is configured, you have direct access to these tools without needing the CLI. The MCP server provides the shared `bridge_*` tools for EXISTING running agent sessions -- it does NOT spawn new agent processes. Claude Code push uses this MCP server's experimental `claude/channel` stdio path; OpenClaw push uses the separate native `openclaw-channel/` plugin.

### MCP tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `bridge_list_machines` | List paired machines and their connection details |
| `bridge_status` | Check if a machine is reachable via SSH |
| `bridge_send_message` | Send a message to another machine's running agent |
| `bridge_receive_messages` | Manual inspection/consumption of the local Claude Code-target inbox (not needed in normal channel mode) |
| `bridge_run_command` | Run a shell command on a remote machine |
| `bridge_clear_inbox` | Clear the local inbox |
| `bridge_inbox_stats` | Get inbox statistics and watcher health |

### Channel plugin (push mode -- Claude Code)

When used with Claude Code, the MCP server acts as a **channel plugin**: one stdio JSON-RPC child advertises both the `bridge_*` tools and the experimental `claude/channel` capability. Incoming messages from other machines are **pushed** directly into the conversation as:
```
<channel source="agent-bridge" from="MachineName" message_id="..." ts="...">content</channel>
```
No polling needed in the normal channel-owner path -- respond using `bridge_send_message`.

On startup, pending Claude Code-target messages are replayed in chronological order. This is replay-on-spawn durability, not a separate always-on daemon; live push still depends on a running Claude Code channel-owner MCP child.

### MCP server setup

```bash
cd ~/Projects/agent-bridge/mcp-server
npm install && npm run build
```

Recommended Claude Code setup is the plugin/marketplace flow in the README. For a tools-only/manual MCP config in a non-Claude host, do not set `AGENT_BRIDGE_PERSONA`; without a Claude Code channel parent, the server exposes tools only and does not claim a Claude Code persona inbox lease:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agent-bridge": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/agent-bridge/mcp-server/build/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

The removed v3 role env vars (`AGENT_BRIDGE_ROLE`, `AGENT_BRIDGE_ALLOW_NON_CHANNEL_PARENT`, `AGENT_BRIDGE_DISABLE_WATCHER`) have no effect in 4.0.0.

### Messaging workflow (channel mode)

1. Machine A's Claude calls `bridge_send_message({ machine: "MacBookPro", message: "check the test results", target: "claude-code/default" })` (or a named persona such as `"claude-code/yolo"`)
2. The message is written to Machine B's target-specific inbox, e.g. `~/.agent-bridge/inbox/claude-code/default/<id>.json`, via SSH
3. Machine B's persona watcher detects the new file
4. Machine B's channel-owner MCP child pushes the message into that running Claude Code persona
5. Machine B's Claude sees `<channel source="agent-bridge" ...>` and responds via `bridge_send_message`

All messages are authenticated via SSH keys. The channel notification includes `authenticated: ssh-key` metadata confirming the sender was verified by the SSH transport.

Messages include sender name, timestamp, content, optional reply-to ID for threading, and TTL (default 1 day, 0 = no expiry).

## Troubleshooting

### SSH not enabling
On macOS, go to System Settings > General > Sharing > Remote Login and enable it manually.

### Firewall blocking connections
```bash
# Check if firewall is on
sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --getglobalstate

# Allow SSH through
sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --add /usr/sbin/sshd
```

### Can't find IP address
```bash
# Get local IP
ipconfig getifaddr en0    # Wi-Fi
ipconfig getifaddr en1    # Ethernet (or en0 on some Macs)

# Or use Tailscale
tailscale ip -4
```

### Using Tailscale
If both machines are on Tailscale, use the Tailscale hostname or IP instead of the local IP. This works across networks.

### Messages not arriving
1. Check watcher health: use `bridge_inbox_stats` tool (Claude Code target)
2. Verify SSH connectivity: `agent-bridge status <machine>`
3. Check the target inbox: `ls ~/.agent-bridge/inbox/claude-code/` or `ls ~/.agent-bridge/inbox/openclaw/default/`
4. Check archives/quarantine: `ls ~/.agent-bridge/inbox/.archive/claude-code/`, `ls ~/.agent-bridge/archive/openclaw/`, and `find ~/.agent-bridge/inbox/.failed -maxdepth 3 -type f -name '*.json'`
5. Check logs: `~/.agent-bridge/logs/mcp-server.log` (Claude Code) or `~/.openclaw/logs/gateway.log` (OpenClaw)
6. Watchers poll every 2 s — no dependencies (fswatch/inotifywait removed in 3.4.3)

## Security notes

- All communication uses SSH with key-based authentication
- Private keys are stored in `~/.agent-bridge/keys/` (mode 600)
- Config is stored in `~/.agent-bridge/config` (mode 600)
- No passwords are stored or transmitted
- All files are stored in `~/.agent-bridge/` with restrictive permissions (mode 700)
- Message content is base64-encoded for SSH transport to prevent shell injection
